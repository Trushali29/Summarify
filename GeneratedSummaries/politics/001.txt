It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme.
"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament."
She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid.
She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children.
She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.
