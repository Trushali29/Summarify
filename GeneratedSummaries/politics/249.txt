
Tony Blair has said he will not take part in a TV debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election. Before the 2001 election, plans for a debate between Mr Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy collapsed. In 1997 a debate between Mr Blair and John Major was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed. In recent years the leader of the opposition has always called for a debate, although it has never happened. Televised debates have become the high point of the US presidential election campaigns.
