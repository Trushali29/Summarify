
Chinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004, the country's government said. China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines.
